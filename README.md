# Real-Time Rocket Telemetry

## Design Problem
The problem is to define the minimum requirement for the rocket telemetry so that it is able to work on real-time data capturing as well as the data transmission after being launched.  

## Objectives
The aim of the project is to:
1.	Observe the capability of data capturing of rocketâ€™s whereabouts as they should provide its exact trajectory and motion on flight.
2.	Identify the proper data for the transmission to the ground station so that they will not burden the system to be carried out in real time environment. 
3.	Test the data transmission between the rocket and the ground station as it moves away on certain motion and range.

## Components Selection
### Wireless connection between rocket and ground station
LoRa is used for the communication as it able transmit a small amount of data over a great distance compared to other well known wireless connection such as WiFi and Bluetooth.
### Data collection for rocket trajectory
GPS is applied on the rocket to collect four major data format which are time, height, coordinates and speed.
